This is a React interview exercise. A few notes:
- Uses Next.js
- Uses Typescript
- Uses Emotion Styled Components

Your task is to clone this repo, create a new branch, develop a component, and create a pull request.
You may use any resources you'd like. Feel free to ask questions.

The component you'll make is modal. You can find a design here: https://www.figma.com/file/6qOchp2x22DoXPZ3V32lWu/Interview?node-id=0%3A1

Good luck!
