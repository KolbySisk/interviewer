This is a React interview exercise. Your task is to clone this repo, create a new branch, develop a component, and create a pull request.
You may use any resources you'd like. Feel free to ask questions.

 A few notes:
- Uses Next.js
- Uses Typescript
- Uses Emotion Styled Components
- `/pages/index.tsx` is the start point
- A Button component has been created and placed on the page
- Goal is to create a modal component that will appear when the button is clicked.

You can find design specs here: https://www.figma.com/file/6qOchp2x22DoXPZ3V32lWu/Interview?node-id=0%3A1

Good luck!
